# ACM Application Repos

This is the central hub for all the applications made for ACM at Washington State University Vancouver. To view an application, see the respective branch.

The master branch only serves as an index page for the other pages. It also holds the default Xamarin.Forms based .gitignore file. Feel free to use any of the apps included in this repo.

- [ACM Official App](https://github.com/tvand7093/ACM/tree/ACM-Official-App)
   - This app is the official app for displaying the current people involved in ACM. In the future this may also show events that the group is holding.

  - This app is the first one of the App A Month event.
